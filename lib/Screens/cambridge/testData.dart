            """Salton makes a range of cars. The level of inventory is too high so it plans to decrease production at its factory. Employees were told the business needs to reduce the size of its workforce as competition is increasing. The trade union is not happy that 360 of the 1200 stalled full time employees at Salton will be made redundant. A trade union spokeswoman said: 'Saltan should reduce the number of hours of every employee rather than reduce the number of jobs.' Saltan's Operations Director is considering ways to increase efficiency in the factory. 

Whet is meant by a 'trade union'? 
Identify two situations (other than increasing competition) when a business might have to reduce the size of its workforce. 
Identify and explain two possible problems for Salton of having a high level of inventory. 
Identify and explain two ways Salton could improve efficiency. 
Do you think Salton should reduce the number of working hours for every employee rather than reduce the number of jobs? Justify your answer. 

""",
        answer: """
a) A group of workers who join together to ensure their rights is better protected through strength in numbers which allows them to undertake collective bargaining that forces the employers to meet the employees/worker’s demands for better wages.

b) Situation 1: When the business is relocating to another country and shutting down its operations in the current location. 
Situation 2: When there is a recession and a business sales have plunged and it can't afford to pay its workers. 

c) Problem 1: Cash flow problems,
Explanation: As the cars are not being sold so they are not being converted to cash quickly leaving Saltan with less working capital which will lead to difficulties in meeting day to day expenses and emergencies which could lead to Saltan's business ceasing to operate. 

Problem 2: High storage costs, 
Explanation: As cars are very expensive, a lot of warehousing costs such as security, insurance, administration, rent will have to be paid to keep such a high level of stock of cars safe. Such high expenses will reduce the profits for Saltan making it difficult for Saltan to grow in the future. 

d) Way 1: Motivation of the staff, 
Saltan could motivate the remaining 840 workers through performance-related pay or the promise of a bonus if they work hard and achieve their objectives. This will give the workers greater incentive and workers will not take leaves and will not waste time or resources thus greater output of cars will be produced with lesser wastage leading to a rise in the efficiency levels.

Way 2: Increase Automation at the car plant, 
The increase in automation will be costly initially but in the long run, there will be less need for labor so the labor costs will go down. Moreover, automation makes precise products and there will be less wastage during production and automation will lead to greater output of cars so Saltan will also benefit from economies of scale and all this will lead to greater efficiency in the long run.

e) Reducing the number of working hours will give the benefit of keeping the workers and Saltan will not have to recruit and train workers in the future if need arises and this will save a lot of costs and time. Further, there will be no need to make workers redundant and this will save redundancy costs and possible trade union actions. By reducing the number of working hours less supervisors and managers will be needed which again is less cost. However, reducing the number of working hours will mean each worker will earn less pay and this can be a great demotivating factor leading to less efficiency and poor quality of cars being produced. Also another drawback for reducing hours may be that workers would seek part time jobs in other car manufacturing companies and will reduce their loyalty towards Saltan and would leak Saltan's trade secrets to the competitors. However it is a better decision to reduce working hours as the union is not happy about the redundancy plan and will go on strikes and take industrial actions like go slow which would halt production overall and this would be much more damaging to the profits as well as the reputation of Saltan.

  F&G is a leading fashion retailer. It has 20 shops in country C. The business uses market segmentation. Its target market is men aged between 25 and 40 years old. The Marketing Director has been looking at the marketing data shown in Table 1. She is worried that the amount the business spends on marketing is not cost effective. She would like to close clown all F&G shops and just use e-commerce. 
 
a) What is meant by 'marketing budget, 
b) Calculate the value of F&G's revenue in 2016. 
c) Identify and explain two benefits of market segmentation to F&G. 
d) Identify and explain two possible reasons why the amount F&G spends on marketing might not be cost effective.
e) Do you think F&G should close down all its shops and just use &commerce? Justify your answer.
  """, answer: """
a) An estimated amount of funds that have been set aside by a business to be spent on the promotion of its goods and services over a specific period of time. Budgets are always based on previous years in order to forecast the estimated amount needed. 

b) F&G's revenue = 12/100 x 700 m = 84 m.

c) Benefit 1:  F&G will be able to spot market gaps. 
Explanation: By market segmentation, F&G will conic across groups of consumers that want certain types of clothes and designs. F&G will be the first to make such clothes for the customers capturing the market gap and helping increase market share more than 12%. 

Benefit 2: F&G will know how to promote in a focused way.
Explanation: Through segmentation F&G will know their exact segment i.e. 25 — 40 males so they will promote on those mediums that are accessed by young men such as sports channels and news-papers. Thus the 40M marketing budget will be used more effectively and there will be less wastage of resources leading to greater profits. 

d) Reason 1: Customers have brand loyalty to other brands, 
Explanation: As F&G have increased their expenditure on marketing from 25M to 40M which is a 60% rise it has only led to revenue increasing from 75M to 84M (12% rise) which shows that greater marketing expenditure is not leading to a proportionate rise in sales clearly indicating that customers are not being attracted towards F&G's clothes as they are still loyal to the brands they are using. 
Reason 2: F&G's marketing mix is not integrated, 
Explanation: It is very possible that certain P’s of F&G's marketing mix is not effective. It is possible that the place is not adequate and F&G are not distributing their garments properly by opening their outlets in the wrong locations which are not popular for shopping or the shops are in locations that do not enjoy good repute. It is possible that men want to purchase mostly online and F&G only has shops and no proper online selling website.

e) Online selling (e-commerce) will bring benefits of less fixed costs as F&G will not have to bear the rents/wages and other costs of the shops. This will be a great reduction of costs increasing profitability. Online selling will provide 24 hours sales as men would be able b.o order the clothes at any time and also from different parts of the country which will help increase the market share as it is falling. Online selling will mean cheaper advertising as now all the advertising will be done on the websites and there will be no longer need to spend 
40M on the marketing. Communication will become easier and convenient and as young men mostly surf the net a lot on their phones, F&G will get more customers, therefore increasing sales. However, online selling will mean large investment in information technology as a website designer and online sales staff will need to be recruited and trained leading to high cash out flows which could cause liquidity problems. Some men may want to try on the clothes and see the fabric and may not buy online. Further websites may be hacked and not every one may have access to the net. All sales will be done through credit card payments and F&G will not receive the cash immediately causing low cash balances. To conclude it is important to offer online selling to fight competitors but F&G should also continue to operate outlets in the good locations to display their goods and enhance their image. Thus both online and shops are needed.

Alex is surprised that the business has made a small profit in the first year 'We can use this profit to expand. I don't know why people think we would benefit from having a business plan. Much of the demand for our repair business comes from our friends who own bicycles

d) Identify and explain two benefits to Alex of having u business partner  
e) Do you think Alex and Raul need a business  plan for the business to be successful in the future? Justify your answer. 
""", answer: """
 (a) Liabilities are financial obligations that have to be paid by the business back to the lenders. Non-current liabilities are those loans and debts that are due to be repaid in more than one year's time such as a long term bank loan.

(b) Working capital = current assets - current liabilities = 2500 - 2000 = 500 

(c) Reason 1: Can pay the suppliers of repair parts on time,
Explanation: With adequate working capital the partners will pay the supplier on time and will be able to avail cash discounts for prompt payments which gives them a benefit of lower costs allowing them to earn profits in the first year. 

Reason 2: Can meet unexpected and emergency expenses, 
Explanation: With adequate working capital the partners will be in a good position to meet unexpected expenses such as repairing tools which will allow the partners to have good quality tools and this will give good quality repairs building customer loyalty in their friends. 

(d) Benefit 1: More capital invested into the business,
Explanation: There is greater capital invested in the business which will help fund the expansion which the partners plan and it will also help them avoid taking loans which would be very risky as the partnership has unlimited liability and if the partners could not pay the loans back it would mean their personal belongings and assets would be confiscated. 

Benefit 2: Alex can share the responsibilities with Raul, 
Explanation: Alex can share the responsibilities with Raul and this allows Alex to specialize in accounts keeping while Raul looks after repairs. Both partners specializing in their respective fields means better quality and greater productivity which will mean better management and better services offered that will help build a brand image for the partners as an efficient business. 

A business plan is a document that outlines the market opportunities and the resources as well as the expected returns of a business. A business plan can contribute to success as it will help the partners secure bank loans which will speed up expansion. A business plan will also help the partners measure success/ failure in the future. The plan will also help in cash flow planning which will keep the business liquid. Further it will give the business a direction and there will be less confusion among the partners as they can keep referring to their plan. However, success cannot only depend on a business plan and it will also depend on external factors like favorable taxes and competitors actions and prices. Also if the prices of motorcycles become cheap then people will be able to afford them and very less people will continue to buy bicycles so there will be less repair work and partners business will go into a huge loss. Therefore business success of Alex and Raul cannot only depend on one factor. Success and profits depend on a number of factors both internal and external and most importantly perhaps success will depend on the effective marketing mix that the partners can come up with. However it is also advisable to make a business plan as it helps any business be more prepared for unforeseen events in the future.

  KLG is based in country X. It specializes in making electrical parts which it sells to washing machine manufacturers in country X The Managing Director is planning to relocate to country Y, which is a low-cost country. She said: 'This will allow us to pay employees low wages for working long hours as there are few legal controls on employment and health and safety. KLG cannot be both ethical and profitable. Changes in exchange rates and import tariffs might cause us problems when we start exporting.

a) What is meant by 'import tariff'? 
b) Identify two benefits to KLG of specialization. 
c) Explain how a change in exchange rates might affect KLG when exporting. 
d) Identify and explain two factors (other than exchange rates and  import tariffs) that KLG should consider when deciding where to in circulation relocate. 
e) The Managing Director believes that `KLG cannot be both ethical and profitable.' Do you agree? Justify your answer. 
 """, answer: """
a) This is a form of protectionism in which the government of a country levies taxes on imported goods in order to increase their prices for the people of the country so that they are discouraged from buying them and switch to buying local goods.

b) Benefit 1: Workers can complete their tasks quickly which will result in greater output of parts potentially increasing sales. 
Benefit 2: Workers will produce higher quality electrical parts which will allow KW to charge higher prices leading to more profits.

c) Exchange rate depreciation means country X's currency will become weaker and this will be an advantage for KLG as they will be able to export more parts as the foreign buyers will find them cheaper resulting in higher sales revenue for KLG. If the currency appreciates and country X currency becomes stronger than KLG electrical parts will become expensive for foreign buyers and KLG will have to lower their prices which would reduce the profit margins for KLG and they will not get the benefit of paying lower wages to the employees . If the exchange rates change very rapidly then both appreciation and depre-ciation will have a very negative effect as sudden losses could occur because KLG will not be able to set their prices effectively due to the rapid changes in exchange rates. 

d) Factor 1: Availability and quality of infrastructure, 
Explanation: As KLG are a manufacturing unit it is important to locate in an area where there is uninterrupted power supply and water supply so that production does not halt and orders can be met. Also a good network of roads is required so that the finished goods can he transported to the airports without damage when they are to be exported. 

Factor 2: Access to cheap/affordable raw material, 
Explanation: As KLG is a manufacturing unit they will need a steady supply of different kinds of raw materials which include plastic, rubber and metal at affordable rates. Thus it is important to locate in a location where they have access to a good raw material supplier that provides good quality at affordable rates. 

e) If KLG adopts an ethical stance then it can be used to enhance their brand image and as a marketing edge. Consumers react positively to firms that are ethical and KLG sales would go up along with profits. Secondly, ethical businesses have motivated workers who then work with commitment. If KLG is unethical and wishes to pay low wages and have long working hours with no care for worker's safety then they will have a demotivated workforce that will indulge in absenteeism and there will be high turnover leading to high losses and low profits.The Government also gives favourable tax rates and subsidies to ethical businesses which will lower costs of production giving more profit-ability. However in many countries that KLG will export to there may be unawareness of ethical issues and customers are usually price conscious and may not buy KLG parts as being ethical means paying good wages, disposing of waste properly and all of this will be increasing the cost of production for KLG making their electrical parts more expensive than the competitors who are unethical and have lower prices which will lower sales and profits of KLG. However in today’s global economy there is increasing awareness about ethics and if a business wants to be sustainable in the long run and wishes to avoid scandals and pressure group actions it is advisable to be ethical as the long run advantages will be profitable.
