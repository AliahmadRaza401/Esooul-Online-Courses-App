    QuestionAnswer(question: '''Please describe your hometown a little. 
''', answer: """ Well, Delhi is the capital of India and by far the largest 
     city in the country. It's a densely populated place, so 
             the city is always crowded and noisy. Also, Delhi has 
             the highest number of vehicles, therefore traffic 
            congestion is a norm here. Also, it has very rich history.
            For this reason, it’s really popular with tourists who

           Indian culture. It's never boring to live here as the city
          provides a wide array of entertainment options. It is also 
         home to our government and all major institutions.

    QuestionAnswer(question: '''Tell me a little about the place where you live 
''', answer: '''I live in Hong Kong. And I should say it's a truly unique 
place. When people generate an image in their heads of 
what Hong Kong looks like, they envision a concrete 
jungle. They imagine movies with famous skyscrapers 
dominating the skyline. Yeah, this is true that the
 lots of skyscrapers here. But actually, it's the biggest
 misconception about Hong Kong cause almost 65 per
 cent of its territory is parks, beaches, and mountain
 And there are lots of amazing hiking trails. Another
 interesting fact is that Hong Kong is one of the ways 
 most expensive places to live in Despite  this it's one of
﻿most heavily populated cities in the world. Nearly 
7,5 people live here. So, there is a lot of busy city life
 going on here, day and night. And it's one of the world's
 most densely populated areas too, especially Hong 
Kong island. It has a population of more than 1 million 
people although it's relatively small. It takes just one 
hour to travel from one side of it to the other. Since the 
population in is very dense, it is very common for 
apartment buildings to have forty floors and for
 apartments to be very small. That's probably the only 
thing that makes me upset, but I'm used to it. As I've
 said before Hong Kong Island is quite small, so 
everything is linked quite closely, and the underground 
system is really efficient. It can take you anywhere 
want to get to. I love living here.
'''),
    QuestionAnswer(question: '''Please describe your hometown a little.
''', answer: ''' My hometown has just about one hundred thousand 
 people which are regarded as a small one. But describe 
 small size, people have a full access to the same
facilities as a large city offers such as department
 stores, schools, cafes, hospitals ... you name it. So, l 
never feel trapped or limited in opportunities. There 
aren't many vehicles here, so it isn't noisy and polluted.
 What is really important is that there are no traffic jams 
even during rush hours.

'''),
    QuestionAnswer(question: '''What is your town well-known for? 
''', answer: '''Well, as it's a resort town, people from all over the 
country as well as from abroad come there to have a 
rest, sunbathe, swim, breathe sea air and eat delicious
 seafood. At the height of the season, usually in July, the
 city is packed with people. My hometown is famous for
 its rich nightlife as well. Along the harbour there are 
some amazing nightclubs and bars for spending an 
unforgettable night out.

'''),
    QuestionAnswer(question: '''What is your town well-known for? 
''', answer: '''I believe a wealth of history and culture is a primary.
 source of attraction for tourists. People come there
 visit museums and many places of historic value U
 as X and Y. Every street is steeped in history. As the
 city is very old,  it consists of several parts. And walking
 around it, you can experience a journey through 
civilizations.

'''),
    QuestionAnswer(question: '''What is your town well-known for? 
''', answer: '''You see, as it's an industrial city, I'm afraid, there's 
nothing it can boast of. There are neither ancient 
buildings nor other places of interest that could
 possibly attract tourists. However, it is in my city that 
the best shoes are produced.

'''),
    QuestionAnswer(question: '''Do you like your hometown? 
''', answer: '''Yeah, it is never boring no matter what your interests. 
It's a large city, so you can easily find where to go and 
what to do. One thing I particularly like about it is that although it is vast, there are a thousand small and intimate places there such as 
peaceful gardens a small friendly restaurant.

'''),
    QuestionAnswer(question: '''Do you like your hometown?
''', answer: ''' I'm afraid not. I don't think it's a great place for living 
 and what irritates me most is the quality of our road  
driving a car every day turns into continuous detecting 
﻿potholes instead of focusing on the road traffic. It's
 more than frustrating. Unfortunately, this list goes on 
and on. There are too few green zones so the city looks 
like the forest of high-rise office and residential 
buildings. You know, it's impossible to get a lung
' Fresh air unless you drive 30 kilometers away from

'''),
    QuestionAnswer(question: '''Is that a big city or a small place?
''', answer: ''' It's neither small nor big. Actually, it largely depends on
 what city you compare it with. I would say it's big,
 enough to provide city dwellers with all necessary 
facilities, whereas it's nowhere near as large as New
 York or Sydney, for example.
'''),
    QuestionAnswer(question: '''Is that a big city or a small place?

 Just imagine, it takes just X minutes to get from one
 end of my hometown to the other.

    QuestionAnswer(question: '''Is that a big city or a small place?

takes hours to go from one side of the city to the other.

 the constant rat race and I'll definitely enjoy a slower

 not possible until I move out of the city.

'''),
    QuestionAnswer(
        question: '''What is the difference between living in the countryside
 And the city? 
''',
        answer: '''I guess that the most striking difference is that if you are 
 Countryside there isn't much traffic even during rush
 Hours. Again, as there are fewer vehicles emitting
, exhaust fumes, rural areas are nowhere near as
 Polluted as urban ones. So the air is definitely fresher
. This is why it's highly likely that people living in the
 Country live longer. However, there may be a number of
 People who won't appreciate these benefits as they
 Aren’t many opportunities for professional growth? 
 The choice of facilities is limited.

'''),
    QuestionAnswer(
        question: '''There's generally not much to do in the countryside,
''',
        answer: '''   Especially in the winter, so I'm sure the majority of 
              Young people like to chat with their friend online or play
             Computer games. They may also like to get together in
             Order to play football, ride bicycles or explore the
            Surroundings. This is because if children are not glued 
        To their devices, they usually have active pastime. The
       More adventurous, the better. Again, as the number of 
      Recreational facilities is severely limited in the
      Countryside, it seems to me that the most popular
     Activity with adults is having barbeque parties or just
       Chatting with their neighbors over the fence.

        answer: ''' Oh, I would say it has undergone sweeping changes 
'cause those who haven't been there for a long time
 can hardly recognize it. First of all, the general quality 
of the city landscape has improved, so it's way more
 Beautiful now. For instance, many ancient buildings

 Tourist attraction.

'''),
    QuestionAnswer(
        question: '''How has your town changed over the last 20 years?
''',
        answer: ''' Well, as far as I can see, the city has undergone
 Tremendous changes as it has turned from a small
 Peaceful town into a large bustling city. It's now 
Approximately twice as large as it used to be. So it 
Means that now it can boast improved infrastructure, 
More places to visit and things to do as a lot of facilities

 like food and housing. This makes people resort to
 Committing crimes in a desperate attempt to survive.
 However, the good bit is that there are signs that the
 Economy is recovering and the government is taking,
 Measures to fight poverty. So, things will probably
 Improve soon.

    QuestionAnswer(question: '''Describe an experience when you were not allowed to use a mobile phone.
''', answer: """The most recent occasion when I couldn't use my
 Smartphone was last month when I was on board a
 Plane flying to X.

             At first, all the passengers boarded the plane and took
           Their seats. When the plane was ready for takeoff, the
             Pilot came over the intercom, greeted the passengers
          And asked everyone to either switch off the phones or           
            Use them in an 'airplane mode', which shuts off phone
            Transmissions during the flight.

           I quickly turned off mine and was really surprised that
          There were still people who refused to follow the rule
           And had a confrontation with a flight attendant.

I know (as I read some articles dedicated to this that
 This may not be so critical an issue when the is 
Already at cruising altitudes as there's no direct 
Evidence of mobile phones or other devices interference
 With aircraft systems, but it's really important due to
 Takeoff and landing phases because of its possible.
 Interference with ground networks, which is dangerous
. You know, there's also no proof that wireless devices
 Do not cause any problems, and I'm sure that the signal
 Of the phone does interfere with navigation instruments
 And can cause instrument display malfunctions. So
 Even during the flight I kept my phone and other
 Devices turned off 'cause I didn't want to be
 Responsible or share responsibility for a crash.

    QuestionAnswer(question: '''Describe a time when you did shopping in a street market.
''', answer: """Several years ago my best friend and I were on holiday
 In X country. Our tour guide recommended us to go to
 The city's oldest street market, which is one of the
 Oldest shopping streets in X, always abuzz with local
 People and holidaymakers who go there to buy spices,
 Fruit, clothing, souvenirs, handicrafts, fabrics, to name
 But a few. He told us that this would be a great way to
 Get an interesting glimpse into local culture and do
 Shopping, and it indeed was an unforgettable life
 Experience.

Now I can safely say that it's by far the most crowded
 Street I have ever seen. Both sides of a narrow medieval
  Street were teeming with people, it was just like a bee
 Hive. Vendors all vied in offering their goods to
 Shoppers. Shoppers from all over the world were
Swarming around stalls so I had to squeeze through
 Crowd to get a closer look at anything that was such
 Couldn’t even stop and look around as the crowd
 Literally dragged me along. It was really noisy.
Despite all the difficulties, I managed to buy spices
 My mom as she likes cooking and some local
Handicrafts and souvenirs because I collect such
 Things.

With my friend, whom I was travelling with, 
 But no sooner had we reached the place than we were
 Separated by the crowd. So we quickly understood that
 There was no point in trying to resist in order to keep
 Together. I just tried to look around every other minute
Not to lose sight of her. For this reason, I can say I went
 There on my own.

 Oh, and I nearly forgot one thing. I had to be very
 Careful not to become pickpockets' victim because
Such crowded places are a paradise for them. 
Interesting as the market's vibrant atmosphere my 
. Shopping lots of fun. But it was a bit dangerous too.

    QuestionAnswer(question: '''Describe a puzzle that you solved.
''', answer: """Well, when I was a child, I was a jigsaw puzzle
             Enthusiast. I assembled puzzles whenever I had a spare
            Moment. But after I had completed a 5000-piece
            Gradient puzzle, I lost interest in this activity. Since then 
            I've been given lots of them, but they are still
            Unopened, collecting dust on some shelf.

 The only puzzle that I have completed since childhood 
Was a 3D wooden mechanical pendulum clock puzzle
 That my friend gave me for my birthday last year. I was
 Really excited 'cause it was something new for me. And I
 Was hoping it would be challenging as well.

 I thought it would take me a while to assemble it,
 But it took me a minute to figure out the process. And once
 You have the hang of it, it's super easy and lots of fun
 So I put it together, all by myself in just a few hour
 There were easy to follow instructions. And need
 Neither glue nor scissors to put it together. The only
 Challenge I faced was that some pieces required a 
 Deal of hand strength to snap together. But it was 
 'cause they snapped together perfectly, making it
Almost impossible to break apart once its assembled.

 So even though it wasn't extremely challenging
, I enjoyed solving it 'cause doing jigsaw puzzles is a really
 Good way to unwind after a hard working day and 
spend quality time on your own.
