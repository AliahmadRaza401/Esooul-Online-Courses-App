     city in the country. It's a densely populated place, so 
             the city is always crowded and noisy. Also, Delhi has 
             the highest number of vehicles, therefore traffic 
            congestion is a norm here. Also, it has very rich history.

      QuestionAnswer(
       question: '''Tell me a little about the place where you live 
''',
       answer: '''I live in Hong Kong. And I should say it's a truly unique 
place. When people generate an image in their heads of 
what Hong Kong looks like, they envision a concrete 
jungle. They imagine movies with famous skyscrapers 
dominating the skyline. Yeah, this is true that the
 lots of skyscrapers here. But actually, it's the biggest
 misconception about Hong Kong cause almost 65 per
 cent of its territory is parks, beaches, and mountain
 And there are lots of amazing hiking trails. Another
 interesting fact is that Hong Kong is one of the ways 
 most expensive places to live in Despite  this it's one of
﻿most heavily populated cities in the world. Nearly 
7,5 people live here. So, there is a lot of busy city life
 going on here, day and night. And it's one of the world's
 most densely populated areas too, especially Hong 
Kong island. It has a population of more than 1 million 
people although it's relatively small. It takes just one 
hour to travel from one side of it to the other. Since the 
population in is very dense, it is very common for 
apartment buildings to have forty floors and for
 apartments to be very small. That's probably the only 
thing that makes me upset, but I'm used to it. As I've
 said before Hong Kong Island is quite small, so 
everything is linked quite closely, and the underground 
system is really efficient. It can take you anywhere 
want to get to. I love living here.

 people which are regarded as a small one. But describe 
 small size, people have a full access to the same
facilities as a large city offers such as department
 stores, schools, cafes, hospitals ... you name it. So, l 
never feel trapped or limited in opportunities. There 
aren't many vehicles here, so it isn't noisy and polluted.
 What is really important is that there are no traffic jams 
even during rush hours.

country as well as from abroad come there to have a 
rest, sunbathe, swim, breathe sea air and eat delicious
 seafood. At the height of the season, usually in July, the
 city is packed with people. My hometown is famous for
 its rich nightlife as well. Along the harbour there are 
some amazing nightclubs and bars for spending an 
unforgettable night out.

       question: '''What is your town well-known for? 
''',
       answer: '''I believe a wealth of history and culture is a primary.
 source of attraction for tourists. People come there
 visit museums and many places of historic value U
 as X and Y. Every street is steeped in history. As the
 city is very old,  it consists of several parts. And walking
 around it, you can experience a journey through 
civilizations.

nothing it can boast of. There are neither ancient 
buildings nor other places of interest that could
 possibly attract tourists. However, it is in my city that 
the best shoes are produced.

It's a large city, so you can easily find where to go and 
what to do. One thing I particularly like about it is that although it is vast, there are a thousand small and intimate places there such as 
peaceful gardens a small friendly restaurant.

''',
       answer: ''' I'm afraid not. I don't think it's a great place for living 
 and what irritates me most is the quality of our road  
driving a car every day turns into continuous detecting 
﻿potholes instead of focusing on the road traffic. It's
 more than frustrating. Unfortunately, this list goes on 
and on. There are too few green zones so the city looks

 what city you compare it with. I would say it's big,
 enough to provide city dwellers with all necessary 
facilities, whereas it's nowhere near as large as New
 York or Sydney, for example.

'''
       ), QuestionAnswer(
       question: '''What is the difference between living in the countryside

''',
       answer: '''I guess that the most striking difference is that if you are 
 Countryside there isn't much traffic even during rush
 Hours. Again, as there are fewer vehicles emitting
, exhaust fumes, rural areas are nowhere near as
 Polluted as urban ones. So the air is definitely fresher
. This is why it's highly likely that people living in the
 Country live longer. However, there may be a number of
 People who won't appreciate these benefits as they
 Aren’t many opportunities for professional growth? 
 The choice of facilities is limited.

'''
       ), QuestionAnswer(
       question: '''There's generally not much to do in the countryside,
''',
       answer: '''   Especially in the winter, so I'm sure the majority of 
              Young people like to chat with their friend online or play
             Computer games. They may also like to get together in
             Order to play football, ride bicycles or explore the
            Surroundings. This is because if children are not glued 
        To their devices, they usually have active pastime. The
       More adventurous, the better. Again, as the number of 
      Recreational facilities is severely limited in the
      Countryside, it seems to me that the most popular
     Activity with adults is having barbeque parties or just
       Chatting with their neighbors over the fence.

 Tremendous changes as it has turned from a small

Approximately twice as large as it used to be. So it
